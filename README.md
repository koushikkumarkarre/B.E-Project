Engineering Final Year Project

• This project’s objective was to provide files and text, be it storing on disk or sending over the Internet

• Designed & Implemented a tool to provide Information security using Cryptology Methodologies

• I used IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY which used higher end bits to store data unlike the lower end bits which are commonly used

• To make this tool more handy for the end user, I included TEXT ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION using the algorithms DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD(DES), ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD(AES) & BLOWFISH
